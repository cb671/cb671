## Abit about ME!

Hi! I'm Cory Brown, Ive graduated at the University of Leicester with a Computer Science Degreee,I am passionate about building real-world tech solutions that make a difference. I enjoy tackling challenging projects, whether it's gamifying learning platforms, analyzing football refereeing decisions, or training AI models to detect wildfires from space.

My strengths lie in full-stack development, Project Management, and software engineering. I'm especially drawn to work that blends creativity, data, and user experience. When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me at the gym, watching football (or analyzing it), deep into anime, or with some Pablo’s.

## 🔭 I’m currently ...

🎓 Studying at La Fosse Academy, sharpening my skills in full-stack development and software engineering best practices

 💻 Building personal projects to strengthen my knowledge of React, Node.js, and RESTful APIs

📚 Working towards becoming a well-rounded developer, with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies

⚽ Enjoying football debates, anime marathons, gym sessions, and chill tracks from Pablo’s in my downtime
